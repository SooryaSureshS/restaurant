                        <p>The privacy policy is one of the most essential legal requirements for websites.</p>

                        <p>Even if you just have a small business or a blog with no income at all, you might be
                            surprised to discover that you still need a privacy policy.
                        </p>

                        <p>Basically, if your website collects personal data, you need a privacy policy that informs
                            your users about this according to privacy laws in most jurisdictions, including the EU and
                            the US.
                        </p>

                        <p>Almost all modern websites function with the use of cookies, so chances are high that your
                            website is collecting personal data, for example for statistical, functional or marketing
                            purposes.
                        </p>

                        <p>In this blogpost, we take a look at what constitutes a good privacy policy, how to make a
                            compliant GDPR privacy policy and whether using a privacy policy generator is a good idea.
                        </p>

                        <p>Learn what the privacy policy is and how to get one for your website below.</p>

                        <h4>What is a privacy policy?</h4>
                        <p>A privacy policy is a document that states what personal data you collect from your users,
                            why, and how you keep it private.
                        </p>

                        <p>The purpose of the privacy policy is to inform your users about how their data is being
                            handled.
                        </p>

                        <p>Hence, the privacy policy should be accessible for your users and kept in a plain and
                            readable language.
                        </p>

                        <p>Most countries have privacy laws requiring that websites collecting personal data have a
                            proper privacy policy in place.
